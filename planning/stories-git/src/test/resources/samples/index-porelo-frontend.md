# Frontend Requirements

The interface people use to work with a Porelo backend, as what must be true for a person using it.
One file per requirement, `F<nn>-Short-Title.md`, each with its acceptance criteria; the number is
identity, not order. Everything is built against `org.fuin.porelo.Tasks1` over the daemon's socket:
[Design](../doc/design.md) says what the interface is made of, [Backend API](../doc/Backend-API.md)
how it talks to a daemon, and [what the contract does not yet cover](../doc/Contract-Gaps.md) what
the backend has no method or field for yet.

Grouped by state, the group's heading naming it, as `AGENTS.md` says how an issue moves through
them; within a group the order is the priority. **Size** is how big what remains is, `—` for an
issue in Review or not yet analyzed; **Open questions**, in *Analyzed* only, counts what waits on the operator, the
issue's *Open questions*; what an agent finds out itself stands under *To be checked* and is not
counted. A finished issue's file is deleted once what outlives it is in `doc/` or `AGENTS.md`;
its row stays under *Finished*, with one sentence of what was built; decisions are in [doc/decisions.md](../doc/decisions.md).

|---|---|---|
| <a id="f386"></a>F386 | A Short Name People Read | The operator's word (2026-11-08): a problem with long task names is handled when one is seen. |
| <a id="f142"></a>F142 | The Drafts Offered Before The First Task In Default | Folded into [F397](#f397): the proposal is the first-start question for a repository in Default, writing its `porelo.yml`, with no project draft to keep. |
| <a id="f221"></a>F221 | A Host's Vault Unlocked From The Secrets File | Replaced by the host vault opened by the person's key: no value of a secrets file is fed to a host's vault. |
| <a id="f244"></a>F244 | A Bring Reads A Private Repository With The Follow's Credential | Replaced by a host that carries its projects and follows them by itself: no bundle of a private repository is made here for a bring. |
| <a id="f245"></a>F245 | The Forge Password Kept Only Once The Forge Took It | No forge password is typed or kept here any more: a forge is reached with a person's key and token. |
| <a id="f246"></a>F246 | The Host Collection Where Every Account Finds It | No account runs a bring or a join from the host's collection any more: a host follows its projects by itself. |
| <a id="f250"></a>F250 | Pasted Host Values Taken As Meant | No host values are pasted any more: machines and projects are chosen from the organization's lists. |
| <a id="f251"></a>F251 | Firefox Reads The Policy The VPN Wrote | The interface sets up no VPN any more: a machine is reached over SSH. |
| <a id="f253"></a>F253 | The Host's Sync Answer Read As Written | The dialog that read that answer is gone: a host follows its projects by itself. |
| <a id="f257"></a>F257 | Follow It Never Ends Without An Answer | The *Follow a project* dialog is gone: a project is put on a machine from the organization's projects. |
| <a id="f260"></a>F260 | The Join Log Without Ansible's Noise | The join's Ansible run is gone: a host follows its projects by itself. |
| <a id="f261"></a>F261 | The Take-Off Checks Its Secrets Entries First | The take-off feeds no such entries any more: taking Porelo off goes by the organization's card. |
| <a id="f64"></a>F64 | The Guided Walk as a Package of Its Own | Replaced by `flutter-guided-walk`, the package of its own this app already depends on. |
| <a id="f279"></a>F279 | The Steps Of One-Click Joining | Replaced by the rebuilt flow from the organization's pages: guided walks and their steps are not kept in this repository. |
| <a id="f218"></a>F218 | The Walks Walked Headless On The Central Test Machines | Guided walks are not kept in this repository. |
| <a id="f75"></a>F75 | One Definition For A UI Test And A Guided Walk | Guided walks are not kept in this repository. |
| <a id="f286"></a>F286 | A Recovery Hold Never Stuck And Its Commit Its Own | Superseded by [F289](README.md#f289): one recovery run at a time with named states and one hold owner replaces this fix of the earlier design. |
| <a id="f285"></a>F285 | A Recovery Run Ended, Pushed And On Its Own Base | Superseded by [F289](README.md#f289): one recovery run at a time with named states and one hold owner replaces this fix of the earlier design. |
| <a id="f283"></a>F283 | A Recovery Request Never Locked, Lost Or Misfiled | Superseded by [F289](README.md#f289): one recovery run at a time with named states and one hold owner replaces this fix of the earlier design. |
| <a id="f281"></a>F281 | A Kept Recovery Commit Finished, Not Made Again | Superseded by [F289](README.md#f289): one recovery run at a time with named states and one hold owner replaces this fix of the earlier design. |
| <a id="f258"></a>F258 | The Join's Secrets File Prepared By The Dialog | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: No secrets file is prepared for a join with one-click joining: the join is one click, the vault unlocks by the person's key. |
| <a id="f256"></a>F256 | Another Machine Of The Same Developer Added By Choice | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: Laptops go with one-click joining: a person reaches the host with their one key from any machine. |
| <a id="f255"></a>F255 | A Laptop Refusal Shown In The Dialog | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: Laptops and their addresses go with one-click joining; developers are added by a pick from the registry. |
| <a id="f254"></a>F254 | A Laptop Address The Host Does Not Use | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: No VPN addresses with one-click joining. |
| <a id="f249"></a>F249 | The Restored Identity Filled On A Recorded Host | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: No identity file is chosen with one-click joining: the person's one key is served by their agent. |
| <a id="f243"></a>F243 | One Sudo Prompt To Connect And Trust A Host | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: No VPN and no CA with one-click joining: there is no sudo prompt to connect a host. |
| <a id="f237"></a>F237 | A Kept CA For Another Network Said Before Renting | Replaced by one-click joining from signed state: The CA goes with one-click joining; nothing is kept for another network. |
| <a id="f220"></a>F220 | A Message In Needs You Checks Again Whether It Still Holds | The recheck exists: a machine that does not answer is asked again every 2 s (`FleetModel`'s retry), and the VPN rows by the periodic refresh; no row was seen staying after its cause was gone. |
| <a id="f139"></a>F139 | OneDrive As The Project's Drive | The host has no drive any more; a user's own drive is [F201](README.md#f201), where OneDrive may come later as an idea of its own. |
| <a id="f150"></a>F150 | The Person's Tunnel Brought Up From The Interface | Merged into [F157](README.md#f157), which brings the VPN up and down from the interface. |
| <a id="f84"></a>F84 | A Signing Key Found Or Made From The Window | Replaced by the person's one key, made and kept in KeePassXC: no signing key is chosen from a file. |
| <a id="f96"></a>F96 | Keys A Machine No Longer Knows, Found By Their Title | Replaced by per-person cards: the interface makes and removes no deploy key at the forge, and clearing a machine only asks its daemon. |
| <a id="f206"></a>F206 | The Host Walk Shows Today's Setup | Replaced by walks kept outside this repository: no walk or stand-in is kept here. |
| <a id="f234"></a>F234 | No Back Once The Server Is Being Prepared | Replaced by `HostDialog`, which has no *Back* once a run stands. |
| <a id="f235"></a>F235 | Leaving The Server Wizard While Machines Shows It | Replaced by `HostDialog`, which closes at once while the run goes on and *Machines* shows it. |
| <a id="f241"></a>F241 | A Project Followed From A Connected Forge | Replaced by the organization's pages: a project comes to a machine from the organization, and *Follow a project* is gone. |
| <a id="f247"></a>F247 | The Bring And Join Log Copied At One Click | Replaced by the rebuilt flow: the bring and join dialogs are gone, and a machine's protocol can be selected. |
| <a id="f248"></a>F248 | A Bring Replaces Its Own Earlier Upload | Replaced by the machine file root alone keeps: the upload per bring or join and its setup folder are gone. |
| <a id="f252"></a>F252 | A Published Access Change Reaches The Host | Replaced by hosts following the organization: a member change is committed there, with no bundle to upload. |
| <a id="f259"></a>F259 | A Grant To Someone Who Already Reads | Replaced by the organization's pages: no dialog grants read access any more, and nothing calls `grantRead`. |
| <a id="f267"></a>F267 | A Project Taken Off From Its Own Menu | Replaced by *Take it off the machine…* on the project's row for that machine's admins. |
| <a id="f287"></a>F287 | A Join Confirmed By What The Host Follows | Replaced by *Connect* per machine: a project is no longer joined. |
| <a id="f289"></a>F289 | A Key Recovered In One Run With Named States | Replaced by Core's `porelo identity revoke --lost` and its backup-key flows, behind `ReplaceLostKeyDialog`. |
| <a id="f294"></a>F294 | A Registry Host Listed For Its Host Admin | Replaced by the organization's list, where every machine stands for its admin. |
| <a id="f297"></a>F297 | Register's Progress With Its Steps And Usual Time | Replaced by a machine's preparation with its own steps: *Register the project* and its signed host action are gone. |
| <a id="f298"></a>F298 | No "null" In A Project Row | Done: a project row adds nothing where its tunnel has nothing to say. |
| <a id="f299"></a>F299 | A Registry Row With The Host's Confirmed State | Replaced by the organization's pages: the registry rows and their confirmed state are gone. |
| <a id="f301"></a>F301 | Persons Of A Project In One Place | Done on the organization's project page: its members stand in one section with *Add*. |
| <a id="f305"></a>F305 | No Join For A Project Already On The Host | Replaced by *Connect* and *Disconnect* per machine: a project offers no *Join*. |
| <a id="f233"></a>F233 | The Server Type And Zone Chosen When Renting | Replaced by `HostDialog` for a machine that exists: `porelo-host up` refuses renting, so no type or zone is chosen. |
